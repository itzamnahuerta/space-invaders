# space-invaders

## A description of the game you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language.

**Game:** Space Invaders 


**Objective:** Defeat aliens by controlling the laser canon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. 

The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the alien's movement and the game's music both speed up. 

The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is declared successful and the game ends tragically. The game will also end if all the player's cannons are destroyed by the enemies.
